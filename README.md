# UalbertaMM Pothole Detection using Dashcam
In this project, we also implemented two additional detection methods to compare with tiny YOLOv3. <br->
Hanming Li implemented YOLOv3. ReadME includes detailed information of installation and how to use the code.
Rui Wand worked on Mask R-CNN for pothole detection. There is also a readme that covers how to set up environment and how to run the program.
